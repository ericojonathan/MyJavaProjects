TextFlow is special layout designed to lay out rich text. It can be used to layout several Text nodes in a single text flow. The TextFlow uses the text and the font of each Text node inside of it plus it own width and text alignment to determine the location for each child. A single Text node can span over several lines due to wrapping and the visual location of Text node can differ from the logical location due to bidi reordering. 
Any other Node, rather than Text, will be treated as embedded object in the text layout. It will be inserted in the content using its preferred width, height, and baseline offset. 

When a Text node is inside of a TextFlow some its properties are ignored. For example, the x and y properties of the Text node are ignored since the location of the node is determined by the parent. Likewise, the wrapping width in the Text node is ignored since the width used for wrapping is the TextFlow's width. The value of the pickOnBounds property of a Text is set to false when it is laid out by the TextFlow. This happens because the content of a single Text node can divided and placed in the different locations on the TextFlow (usually due to line breaking and bidi reordering). 

The wrapping width of the layout is determined by the region's current width. It can be specified by the application by setting the textflow's preferred width. If no wrapping is desired, the application can either set the preferred with to Double.MAX_VALUE or Region.USE_COMPUTED_SIZE.
